List of major "TODO" items left:
 - Transaction manager replay log on restart.  Necessary for txman to come back
   after a crash.
 - Locking in the key-value store.  Necessary to actually uphold serializability.
   This will require implementing SCAN first, otherwise it will need to be
   rewritten.
 - Client-DC affiliation (currently just picks one group at random per
   transaction)
 - Garbage collection of in-memory structures
 - Garbage collection of log
 - SCAN(k, n) operation.  Equivalent to selecting the next n keys >= k.
 - Testing
 - Optimization
    - Durable log throughput/latency
    - Remove early phases of paxos with implicit leader
